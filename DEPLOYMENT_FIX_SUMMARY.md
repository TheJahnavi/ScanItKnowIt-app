# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The previous deployment failed with the error:
> The pattern "server/api/index.js" defined in `functions` doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the `api` directory.

## Root Cause

Vercel expects Serverless Functions to be located in specific directories following conventional patterns:
1. Files in the `api/` directory at the project root
2. Files in the `pages/api/` directory (for Next.js projects)
3. Files in the `src/pages/api/` directory (for Next.js projects with src directory)

Our previous configuration was pointing to `server/api/index.js`, which is not in a conventional location that Vercel recognizes for Serverless Functions.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Moved API Entry Point to Conventional Location

- Moved `server/api/index.ts` to `api/index.ts` at the project root
- Updated imports in the new `api/index.ts` to correctly reference server modules
- Added proper HTTP method exports for Vercel Serverless Functions

### 2. Updated vercel.json Configuration

Changed from:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "server/api/index.js": {
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/server/api/index.js"
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index.js"
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. Ensured Proper Exports

The new `api/index.ts` file now properly exports:
- `default` - The Express app
- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` - Individual HTTP method handlers

## Verification

The deployment has been successfully triggered with the corrected configuration. The Vercel dashboard shows the deployment as "Ready".

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the deployment logs to ensure proper initialization
2. Test API endpoints once the deployment is fully active
3. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for full functionality

## Files Modified

1. `api/index.ts` - New API entry point following Vercel conventions
2. `vercel.json` - Updated function paths and rewrites

## Commit Message

"FIX: Corrected Vercel function path from server/api/index.ts to conventional api/index.ts to resolve build error. Moved api entry point to root api/ directory and updated imports to point to server modules."
