# ScanItKnowIt Deployment Plan

This document contains all the essential information required for a successful deployment of the ScanItKnowIt application, organized by the categories specified by the Deployment Team Lead.

## I. Deployment Target & Code

### Artifact ID/Version
- **Application Name**: ScanItKnowIt
- **Current Version**: 1.0.0
- **Git Commit Hash**: [To be determined at deployment time]
- **Build Artifact Location**: `/dist` directory
- **Repository**: [GitHub Repository URL]

### Target Environment
- **Environment Name**: Production
- **Platform**: Vercel (Serverless Functions)
- **Region**: Automatic (Global Edge Network)

### Deployment Method
- **Deployment Type**: Direct-replacement deployment via Vercel's GitHub integration
- **Strategy**: Vercel automatically handles the deployment process using its Zero Config mode
- **Downtime**: Minimal (typically < 1 second as Vercel routes traffic to the new deployment once it's ready)

## II. Technical Requirements

### Configuration
All environment-specific variables are configured in Vercel's Environment Variables section:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (required for AI features)
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` (optional for Reddit integration)
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional for Reddit integration)
- `API_NINJAS_KEY` (optional for additional services)

### Secrets/Credentials
- **Required Secrets**:
  - OpenRouter API Key (mandatory)
  - Reddit API Credentials (optional but recommended)
  - API Ninjas Key (optional)
- **Storage Location**: Vercel Environment Variables (securely encrypted)
- **Access Method**: Automatically injected into the runtime environment

### Database Changes
- **Schema Changes**: None required
- **Migration Scripts**: Not applicable (application uses in-memory storage)
- **Data Storage**: Session-based in-memory storage (data is cleared on application restart)
- **Backup Strategy**: Manual export of session data if needed

### Dependencies
External services that must be available and functional:
1. OpenRouter API (for AI analysis features)
2. Reddit API (for product review aggregation)
3. Hugging Face API (for specialized AI tasks)
4. Web search APIs (for additional information)
5. GitHub (for CI/CD integration)
6. Vercel (for deployment platform)

## III. Execution & Contingency

### Deployment Plan
Step-by-step deployment process:

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**:
   - Run `npm run verify-deployment` to ensure all checks pass
   - Confirm all environment variables are set in Vercel
   - Create Git tag for the release (e.g., v1.0.0)

2. **Trigger Deployment**:
   - Push code to the main branch of the GitHub repository
   - Vercel automatically detects the push and starts the build process

3. **Monitor Build Process**:
   - Watch Vercel build logs for successful completion
   - Verify that both client and server builds complete without errors

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check Vercel preview URL for initial verification
   - Run smoke tests using `npm run smoke-test`

### Rollback Plan
Clear procedure to revert to the previous stable version:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Notify team and stakeholders of deployment issues
   - Document the problem with screenshots/logs
   - Determine if immediate rollback is required

2. **Rollback Steps**:
   - In Vercel Dashboard, navigate to the previous successful deployment
   - Click "Deploy" to redeploy the previous version
   - Estimated rollback time: < 2 minutes

3. **Post-Rollback**:
   - Verify application functionality is restored
   - Communicate status to users
   - Schedule investigation of the issue
   - Update documentation with lessons learned

### Backups
- **Source Code**: Automatically backed up in GitHub repository with full history
- **Environment Configuration**: Stored in Vercel project settings
- **Previous Deployments**: Available in Vercel deployment history
- **Manual Backup**: Can be performed by exporting the current deployment as a build artifact

### Smoke Test Plan
Mandatory post-deployment validation steps:

1. **Application Loading**:
   - Verify main application page loads at the deployed URL
   - Confirm no JavaScript errors in browser console

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Test health check endpoint: `GET /api/health`
   - Verify all API routes are accessible

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Test camera functionality (simulated)
   - Verify sample product analysis completes
   - Test chat interface response

4. **Static Assets**:
   - Confirm CSS and JavaScript files are loading
   - Verify images and other assets are accessible

## IV. Validation & Monitoring

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
Key performance indicators that define a successful deployment:
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for API calls
- **Uptime**: 99.9%
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Successful Analysis Rate**: > 95%
- **Build Success Rate**: 100% (builds should complete without errors)

### Monitoring Endpoints
Health check URLs and monitoring dashboards:
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `https://[your-domain].vercel.app/api/health`
- **Application Endpoint**: `https://[your-domain].vercel.app/`
- **API Endpoint Base**: `https://[your-domain].vercel.app/api/`
- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in dashboard in Vercel project
- **Custom Monitoring**: Can be set up using third-party tools

### Alerting Thresholds
Agreed-upon severity and thresholds for immediate post-deployment alerts:
- **API Response Time**: > 5 seconds (High priority)
- **Error Rate**: > 5% (Critical)
- **Failed Builds**: Any build failure (Critical)
- **High Memory Usage**: > 80% (Medium priority)
- **500 Errors**: Any 500-series errors (High priority)

## V. Administrative & Approval
