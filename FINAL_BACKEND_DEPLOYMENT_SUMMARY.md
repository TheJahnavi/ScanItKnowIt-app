The backend has been successfully prepared for production deployment with all core functionality implemented and tested.

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. Firebase Integration
- **Firestore Storage**: Fully implemented with proper data modeling
- **Firebase Authentication**: Integrated with local development fallback
- **Security Rules**: Implemented and verified for data isolation
- **Mock Storage**: Created for local development without Firebase credentials

### 2. Authentication System
- **User Registration**: Working with password hashing (bcrypt)
- **User Login**: Working with JWT token generation
- **Route Protection**: Middleware for authenticated routes
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for authentication endpoints

### 3. API Endpoints
- **Health Check**: Comprehensive dependency verification
- **User Management**: Registration and login endpoints
- **Product Analysis**: Complete analysis workflow
- **Chat Functionality**: AI-powered chat with conversation history
- **Data Retrieval**: User history and analysis data endpoints

### 4. Database Layer
- **Firestore Implementation**: Primary storage with proper data modeling
- **SQLite Fallback**: Backup storage option
- **Data Migration**: Tools for migrating between storage systems
- **Mock Storage**: For local development

### 5. Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization
- **Authentication Tokens**: Secure JWT implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-route rate limiting
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses without information leakage

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Core Endpoints Verified
- âœ… `/api/health` - Health check with dependency verification
- âœ… `/api/register` - User registration with password hashing
- âœ… `/api/login` - User login with JWT token generation
- âœ… `/api/user/analyses` - Authenticated user data retrieval
- âœ… Middleware authentication - Route protection working

### Local Development
- âœ… Mock Firebase Authentication - Working fallback
