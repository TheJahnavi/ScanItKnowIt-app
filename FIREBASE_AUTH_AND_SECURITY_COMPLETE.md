## Security Enhancement Details

### Product Image Storage Security Fix

The original storage rules for product images were too permissive, allowing any authenticated user to write to any analysis ID path:

```javascript
// FLAWED RULE - Any authenticated user could write to any analysis
match /products/{analysisId}/image.{extension} {
  allow read;
  allow write: if request.auth != null; // SECURITY FLAW
}
```

This has been corrected to verify that the user owns the corresponding product analysis document:

```javascript
// CORRECTED RULE - Only the analysis owner can write
match /products/{analysisId}/image.{extension} {
  allow read;
  // Secure write access: Only allow write if user owns the corresponding analysis
  allow write: if request.auth != null &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/product_analyses/$(analysisId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

This fix ensures that:
1. Only authenticated users can write product images
2. Users can only write images for analyses they own
3. Data isolation is maintained between users
4. The principle of least privilege is enforced

## Client-Side Implementation Status

**Important Note**: While the server-side Firebase integration is complete, the client-side application currently does not use Firebase Storage for image uploads. The application processes images directly from the upload buffer and discards them.

To fully utilize the Firebase Storage security rules that have been implemented, client-side changes are needed:

1. **Install Firebase Client SDK**
2. **Initialize Firebase** in the client application
3. **Update image upload logic** to use Firebase Storage directly
4. **Follow the required path structure** (`/products/{analysisId}/image.{extension}`)
5. **Ensure proper authentication context** for security rule validation

See [FIREBASE_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_NEEDED.md](FIREBASE_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_NEEDED.md) for detailed implementation instructions.
